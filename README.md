# Dynamic-Price-Prediction-For-Ride-Sharing-Applications
A simulation to implement a scalable solution to effectively predict the cost of a ride dynamically for ride-sharing services. 

This project showcases a **Dynamic Price Prediction Simulation** for ride-sharing platforms using **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Streamlit**. It provides an interactive interface for analyzing and predicting ride prices based on real-world factors such as demand, supply, location, and time of day.  

## Project Overview  
The simulation models how ride prices vary dynamically, offering a hands-on tool for ride-sharing companies and researchers to explore pricing mechanisms.  

### Key Features 🌟  
- **Interactive User Interface**:  
  - Built using **Streamlit** for a seamless and intuitive user experience.  
  - Displays inputs and real-time price predictions on a clean dashboard.  

- **Dynamic Pricing Factors**:  
  - Price predictions based on:  
    - 🚦 Traffic conditions  
    - 📅 Time of day (peak vs. non-peak hours)  
    - 📍 Pickup and drop-off locations  
    - 📊 Demand-Supply ratio  

- **Python for Backend**:  
  - Implements **Machine Learning algorithms** to predict prices dynamically.  
  - Models trained using sample datasets for accuracy.  

- **JavaScript and CSS for Frontend**:  
  - Enhances the simulation's interactivity and aesthetic appeal.  
  - JavaScript ensures smooth real-time data visualization.  
  - CSS styles the interface for a professional look.  

- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Uses **Streamlit** and **Matplotlib** to display graphs, maps, and insights.  
  - Real-time charts to analyze demand trends and pricing patterns.  

- **Custom Scenarios Simulation**:  
  - Allows users to input hypothetical scenarios (e.g., high demand, rain) and see price predictions instantly.  

### Tech Stack 🛠️  
- **Python**: Backend development, ML model training, and API integration.  
- **Streamlit**: Web app framework for an interactive simulation.  
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic elements and real-time updates.  
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend design and layout.  

### How It Works ⚙️  
1. **Input Factors**: Users input key variables like location, time, and traffic conditions.  
2. **ML Prediction**: A pre-trained machine learning model predicts the price dynamically.  
3. **Visualization**: Graphs and charts display predictions and trends.  
4. **Custom Scenarios**: Users simulate real-world cases to observe price fluctuations.  

### Applications 🚀  
- **Ride-Sharing Companies**: Optimize pricing strategies and improve user experience.  
- **Researchers**: Study dynamic pricing models in real-world scenarios.  
- **Educators**: Teach dynamic pricing concepts interactively.  

### Future Enhancements 🔮  
- Integration with **real-time data APIs** for live predictions.  
- More complex pricing models with deep learning.  
- Multi-language support for a broader audience.
